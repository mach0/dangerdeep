Physical rigid body simulation.

fixme compute_force_and_torque: replace by function that computes positions and
forces applied there? torque can be computed internally then. that way we don't
need to take the orientation out of here... only offer function that gets a list
of forces applied in world space

fixme: medium drag causing sideways movement has to be implemented correctly in
sea_object!

Forces are applied to a body leading to a linear force and a torque.
The values are integrated over time to compute linear and angular momentum
and finally position and orientation.

Force comes from screws/rudders etc. and also from the medium pushing on the
body. This explains why moving objects can do curves even if no more force
applied: The surrounding medium causes drag that slows the body down but because
of the shape of the object it can also generate linear momentum that is not in
move direction causing the body to change direction of movement. For example
ships or airplanes move forward, and when turning change their orientation. They
sill move forward but the medium will bounce off their side causing a push to
the side, so the drag will not only slow them down but also make them move
sideways. This leads to a linear movement that is following the changed
orientation. This explains how bodies can change their direction only with
internal force/energy.
For ships we simulate voxels that generate lift values causing the ship to
change orientation with water height values.

compute force at bow/stern/mid/left side/right side or some other important
points. like where the trim tanks of subs are.

the torque is computed as

M = (r1 - r0) x F1, where F1 is the force acting at point r1, where r0 is center
of gravity do r1-r0 is the vector from the object's center to the point where F1
is acting. M is a vector definining axis of rotation (direction of M) and
strength of rotation (length of M). To compute total torque, sum all M over i:
M_total = Sum_i (r_i - r0) x F_i

To compute translational forces, just sum up all forces F: F_total = Sum_i F_i.

Problem: orientation is stored as quaternion, not as three angles.
torque changes angular velocity over time, and that changes orientation over
time. The axes of torque or angular velocity don't need to be identical! That is
the problem. Given torque, angular velocity and orientation as quaternions q_t,
q_v and q_r we have q_v' = q_v * (q_t * delta_t) q_r' = q_r * (q_v * delta_t)
But computing q * z, where q is a quaternion for rotation (unit quaternion) and
z is a number is not that easy. q represents a rotation around an axis x and and
angle w. q * z would then be the rotation around the same axis, but with angle
w*z. A rotation quaternion for axis x and angle w is given as: (cos(w/2),
sin(w/2)*x) Thus q*z would be (cos(w*z/2), sin(w*z/2)*) how to compute that from
q? we would need an acos function call, which is very costly... One could also
see cos(w/2),sin(w/2) as complex number. It has an absolute value of 1. So
multiplying the angle with n would be the same as taking the n'th power of that
number. But this computation would also be very costly - it is the same problem
as we have here. Alternativly: Represent angular velocity and torque around
three fix axes. Store axis and angle for each part, like x/y/z-axis and the
three angles. Changing angular velocity by torque is easy then, orientation
could still be stored as quaternion.

Computing orientation forced by the waves:
Compute buoyancy on points around the ship. Draught gives weight of displaced
water, the difference of the ships weight (or the weight of that part for which
the buoyancy is computed) gives a force, that is applied to the ship. Force =
mass * acceleration. Acceleration is g, mass is difference between displaced
water and the ship's part.

    /* general formulas:
       Total force acting on a body is just the sum of all forces acting on it.
       Total torque is the sum over all forces with index i, with summands
       (p_i - x) cross F_i.
       F_i is the force.
       p_i is the point in 3-space where F_i acts.
       x is the gravitational center of the body.
       Hence: total torque = sum xr_i cross F_i  (xr : relative position).
       Torque is a vector, that has a direction and a length.
       The direction is the axis around that the torque/force acts,
       and the length is proportional to the amount of the torque.
       In our current model the length would be proportional to the turn
       acceleration.
